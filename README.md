# ComPears Backend

Node.js + Express + TypeScript API for the ComPears grocery price comparison platform. Data is currently **NL** (Dutch supermarkets); the API is structured so **DE** (Germany) and **UK** can be added later (e.g. `?country=de` or separate data dirs).

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and set `PORT` (default 4000). Optionally set `OPENAI_API_KEY` for AI normalization.

3. Seed product data and store locations (optional; run from project root so `compears-data-wrangling` is a sibling of `backend`):
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   npm run import-stores
   ```
   Or set `WRANGLING_PATH` to the path of `compears-data-wrangling` if it lives elsewhere.

   Store locations are imported from **OpenStreetMap** (not hand-maintained). Re-run `npm run import-stores` to refresh; CI updates weekly with product seed.

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   API runs at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Stores (NL)

All seven data-wrangling stores are supported: **Albert Heijn**, **Jumbo**, **ALDI**, **Dirk**, **Lidl**, **Coop**, **PLUS**. Seed from `compears-data-wrangling` with `npm run seed`.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` – Health check
- `GET /stores` – List stores and product counts
- `GET /products` – List products (query: `?search=...`, `?store=albert-heijn`, `?barcode=8710...`, `?labels=vegan,gluten-free`)
- `GET /products/:id` – Get product by id
- `GET /stores/locations` – Store locator (query: `?chain=jumbo`, `?lat=52.37&lng=4.89&radius=25`)
- `GET /compare/:canonicalName` – Compare prices across stores for a canonical product name
- `GET /deals` – Products with active promotions
- `GET /deals/digest` – Weekly deals summary
- `POST /lists` – Create a shareable shopping list (JSON body: `{ name, items[] }`)
- `GET /lists/:id` – Fetch shared list by id
- `PATCH /lists/:id` – Update shared list
- `GET /api/v1/docs` – Public API documentation (read-only mirror of product/store/deals endpoints)
- `GET /api/v1/*` – Public API v1 (optional `PUBLIC_API_KEY` via `x-api-key`)
- `POST /receipts/parse` – Parse, safely match, and persist a receipt
- `GET /receipts` – List the caller's receipts (`x-compear-user-id`)
- `PATCH /receipts/:id/lines/:lineIndex` – Re-match a line (`{ action: "rematch", correctedName }`) or mark it unmatched (`{ action: "unmatched" }`)
- `DELETE /receipts/:id` / `DELETE /receipts` – Delete one or all receipts
- `POST /scrape/:store` – Trigger scraper or seed for a store (e.g. `albert-heijn`, `seed-all`)
- `GET /scrape/status` – Last scrape run status

## Scraper

- Run Albert Heijn scraper via API: `POST /scrape/albert-heijn`
- Or CLI: `npm run scrape:ah`
- Requires Playwright: `npx playwright install chromium`

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t compears-backend .
docker run -p 4000:4000 compears-backend
```

Product JSON is baked into the image at `dist/data/` during `npm run build`.

## Deploy to Render

1. Push this `backend/` folder to GitHub (own repo, or as `backend/` in your monorepo with **Root Directory** set to `backend` in Render).
2. In [Render](https://render.com): **New → Blueprint** and point at `render.yaml`, or **New → Web Service** with:
   - **Build command:** `npm ci && npm run build`
   - **Start command:** `npm start`
   - **Health check path:** `/health`
3. Set environment variables (see `.env.example`). Render sets `PORT` automatically.
4. After deploy, set on Netlify: `VITE_API_URL=https://<your-render-service>.onrender.com`

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Yes | `https://compears.shop,https://www.compears.shop` |
| `SCRAPE_API_KEY` | Yes | Long random string; send as `x-api-key` on scrape routes |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | AI normalization, promo interpretation, receipt OCR |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | No | Text AI model (default `gpt-5.5`) |
| `OPENAI_VISION_MODEL` | No | Receipt image model (default `gpt-5.5`) |
| `AI_MAX_VISION_PER_USER_HOUR` | No | Receipt uploads per user per hour (default `5`) |
| `AI_MAX_VISION_PER_USER_DAY` | No | Vision calls per user per day (default `20`) |
| `AI_MAX_TEXT_PER_RECEIPT` | No | Name-normalization AI calls per receipt (default `15`) |
| `AI_MAX_GLOBAL_DAY` | No | Total OpenAI calls per day (default `600`) |
| `RECEIPT_RETENTION_DAYS` | No | Parsed receipt retention in days (default `365`; enforced when receipt data is accessed) |

**Note:** Playwright scrapers (`POST /scrape/:store`) are not suitable on Render’s free tier (no browser, ephemeral disk). Use the data-wrangling pipeline + `npm run seed` locally or via CI, then commit updated `src/data/*.json`.

## Data

- JSON files in `src/data/` (e.g. `albert-heijn.json`, `jumbo.json`)
- AI cache: `src/data/ai-cache.json` (created when using OpenAI)

## Receipt privacy and retention

Receipt images are held in memory only while they are prepared and sent to the configured AI
provider; ComPear does not persist the image itself. Parsed line items, totals, match decisions,
upload time, and image MIME type are persisted per pseudonymous `x-compear-user-id`, with at most
200 receipts per user and a default retention of 365 days. Deployments should review the AI
provider's own data-handling terms separately.

Deleting a receipt, clearing receipt history, expiry, or eviction from the 200-receipt limit also
removes AI-cache entries tracked while processing that receipt. Older receipts created before cache
tracking do not contain enough information to identify those cache entries safely, so unrelated
shared cache entries are deliberately left intact.
